       <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/pool2/impl/GenericObjectPool.html">GenericObjectPool</a>:
       ObjectPool implementation with configurable LIFO/FIFO behavior.
       The default behavior is for the pool to act as a LIFO queue. What this
       means is that when there are idle objects available in the pool, 
       borrowObject returns the most recently returned ("last in") instance.
       If the <code>lifo</code> the property of the pool false, instances are
       returned in the opposite order - first-in, first-out.

       <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/pool2/impl/SoftReferenceObjectPool.html">SoftReferenceObjectPool</a>: 
       ObjectPool implementation with a LIFO (Last In First Out) behavior. Additionally this pool wraps 
       each object in a SoftReference allowing the garbage collector to remove them in response to 
       memory demand.
