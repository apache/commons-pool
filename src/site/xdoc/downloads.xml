         <p>
            The latest release binary and source releases are always available on the
            <a href="http://commons.apache.org/pool/download_pool.cgi">
            Apache Commons Pool Downloads page</a>.

              Version 2 is a major refactoring. The primary change is in the
              underlying implementation which uses significantly less locking
              and is therefore much better suited to high concurrency
              environments. The API has also been made much more self-consistent
              with a number of attributes changing name to clarify their
              purpose. 
           </li>
           <li>
              Version 1.6 adds generics based on the latest 1.5.x release, 1.5.7
              at the present time. It requires Java 1.5.
           </li>
           <li>
              Versions 1.3 through 1.5 depend at runtime only on a Java 1.3 or better JVM.
           </li>
           <li>
              Version 1.2 depends at runtime on
            <a href="http://commons.apache.org/collections/">commons-collections</a>.
           </li>

            moved into a

            special archive area</a>.
