      <p>
         Generic Object pooling API with several implementations.
      </p>
      <p>
         The <code>org.apache.commons.pool2</code> package defines a simple
         interface for a pool of object instances, and a handful of base
         classes that may be useful when creating pool implementations.
         The API supports pooling of unique objects which can be requested
         via a key as well as pools where all objects are equivalent.
      </p>
      <p>
         The <code>org.apache.commons.pool2.impl</code> package contains
         several pool implementations.
         {@link org.apache.commons.pool2.impl.GenericObjectPool
         GenericObjectPool} has many configuration options and can support
         a limited set of objects such as would be useful in a database
         connection pool.
         {@link org.apache.commons.pool2.impl.SoftReferenceObjectPool
         SoftReferenceObjectPool} has no limit on the number of objects in the
         pool, but the garbage collector can remove idle objects from the pool
         as needed.  There is also a keyed version of
         {@link org.apache.commons.pool2.impl.GenericObjectPool
         GenericObjectPool},
         {@link org.apache.commons.pool2.impl.GenericKeyedObjectPool
         GenericKeyedObjectPool}
      </p>
      <p>
         Here is a simple example of pooling <code>HashMap</code> instances.
         First create an {@link org.apache.commons.pool2.PoolableObjectFactory
         PoolableObjectFactory}
      </p>
<pre>
    public class HashMapFactory
        extends {@link org.apache.commons.pool2.BasePoolableObjectFactory BasePoolableObjectFactory}&lt;Map&lt;Object,Object&gt;&gt;
    {
        /**
         * Creates an instance that can be returned by the pool.
         * @return an instance that can be returned by the pool.
         */
        public Map&lt;Object,Object&gt; makeObject()
            throws Exception
        {
            return new HashMap&lt;Object,Object&gt;();
        }

        /**
         * Uninitialize an instance to be returned to the pool.
         * @param obj the instance to be passivated
         */
        public void passivateObject(Map&lt;Object,Object&gt; obj)
            throws Exception
        {
            obj.clear();
        }
    }
</pre>
      <p>
         A class that makes frequent use of a Map could then use a pool
         as shown below:
      </p>
<pre>
    public class Foo
    {
        private {@link org.apache.commons.pool2.ObjectPool ObjectPool&lt;Map&lt;Object,Object&gt;&gt;} pool;
        public Foo()
        {
            {@link org.apache.commons.pool2.PoolableObjectFactory PoolableObjectFactory&lt;Map&lt;Object,Object&gt;&gt;} factory = new HashMapFactory();
            pool = new StackObjectPool&lt;Map&lt;Object,Object&gt;&gt;(factory, 1000);
        }

        public doSomething()
        {
            ...
            Map&lt;Object,Object&gt; map = null;
            try
            {
                map = pool.borrowObject();
                // use map
                ...
            }
            finally
            {
                if (map != null)
                {
                    pool.returnObject(map);
                }
            }
            ...
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>
The above example shows how one would use an
{@link org.apache.commons.pool2.ObjectPool ObjectPool}.  The other supplied
implementations or another special purpose pool would be used similarly.
