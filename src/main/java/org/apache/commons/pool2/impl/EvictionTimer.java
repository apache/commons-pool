/**
 * Provides a shared idle object eviction timer for all pools.
 * <p>
 * This class is currently implemented using {@link ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor}. This implementation may change in any
 * future release. This class keeps track of how many pools are using it. If no pools are using the timer, it is
 * cancelled. This prevents a thread being left running which, in application server environments, can lead to memory
 * leads and/or prevent applications from shutting down or reloading cleanly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class has package scope to prevent its inclusion in the pool public API. The class declaration below should
 * *not* be changed to public.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is intended to be thread-safe.
 * </p>
