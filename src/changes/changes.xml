This file is also used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the 
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a JIRA search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
SVN commits. TBA how to use this with SVN.

To generate the release notes from this file:

mvn changes:announcement-generate -Prelease-notes [-Dchanges.version=nnn]

then tweak the formatting if necessary 
and commit

The <action> type attribute can be add,update,fix,remove.

there are some behavior changes introduced to resolve bugs, remove ambiguity
or improve robustness. Among these are the change in default behavior of
GenericObjectPool and GenericKeyedObjectPool from FIFO back to LIFO queues
(as in 1.2 and earlier). The LIFO/FIFO behavior is now configurable. Some of
the extra synchronization included in version 1.3 was removed / refactored to
improve performance. The javadoc has also been made more complete and explicit.
See the detailed list of changes below for specifics on fixed bugs and behavior
changes in Commons Pool 1.4. This version of Commons Pool depends only on
JDK version 1.3 or higher. Classes implementing pools are all intended to be
threadsafe.">

      <action dev="psteitz" type="fix" issue="POOL-86">
        Fixes to address idle object eviction and LIFO/FIFO behavior reported
        in POOL-86. Made LIFO/FIFO behavior configurable for GenericObjectPool and
        GenericKeyedObjectPool, with default set back to LIFO (reverting to 1.2 behavior).
        Fixed GOP, GKOP evict method and added tests to ensure objects are visited in
        oldest-to-youngest order. Changed backing store for GOP, GKOP pools back to Commons
        Collections CursorableLinkedList (brought this class in, repackaged with package scope).

         Added a wrapper for the shared idle object eviction timer for all
         pools. The wrapper class wraps the Timer and keeps track of how many
         pools are using it. If no pools are using the timer, it is canceled.
         This prevents a thread being left running which, in application server
         environments, can lead to memory leaks and/or prevent applications
         from shutting down or reloading cleanly.

      <action def="psteitz" type="fix" issue="POOL-117">
        Made behavior on instance validation failure consistent across pools,

        create valid objects.

        GenericObjectPool, GenericKeyedObjectPool, SoftReferenceObjectPool,

        returnObject, invalidateObject.  In each case, the operation is allowed
        to proceed, reporting the state of the pool that is being shut down, or
        destroying objects returning to the closed pool.

      <action dev="sandymac" type="update">
        StackObjectPool, SoftReferenceObjectPool, GenericKeyedObjectPool. Allowed
        borrowObject to continue (either examining additional idle instances or
        with makeObject) when an exception is encountered activating an idle
        object instead of propagating the exception to the client.  Also made

        created instances.

        BaseObjectPool, BaseKeyedObjectPool. Instead of throwing
