${project.name} ${version} Release Notes
------------------------------------------------

The ${developmentTeam} is pleased to announce the release of ${project.name} ${version}.

Apache Commons Pool provides an object-pooling API and several object-pool implementations.
Version 2 contains a completely rewritten pooling implementation compared to the 1.x series.
In addition to performance and scalability improvements, version 2 includes robust instance
tracking and pool monitoring.

Version 2.7.x and up requires Java 8 or above.
Version 2.6.x requires Java 7 or above.
Version 2.5.x requires Java 7 or above.
Version 2.0 requires 6 or above. 

NOTE: The MBean interfaces (DefaultPooledObjectInfoMBean, GenericKeyedObjectPoolMXBean,
      and GenericKeyedObjectPoolMXBean) exist only to define the attributes and methods
      that will be made available via JMX. Clients must not implement them as
      they are subject to change between major, minor, and patch version releases of
      Commons Pool. Clients that implement any of these interfaces may not
      be able to upgrade to a new minor or patch release without requiring code
      changes.

## The available variables are described here:
## http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-changes-plugin/examples/using-a-custom-announcement-template.html
##
## Hack to get line breaks to work in release description. For this to work, each line break in the
## release description attribute in changes.xml needs to be preceded by a single space.
#set( $desc = $release.desc )
#set( $desc2 = $desc.replace($esc.newline, "  ") )
#set( $d = $desc2.replace("  ",$esc.newline) )
${d}

## set up indent sizes. Only change indent1
#set($props=${project.properties})
#set($jiralen=$props.get("commons.jira.id").length())
## indent1 =   POOL-nnnn:
#set($blanklen=$jiralen+6)## +6 for "-nnnn:"
## must be at least as long as the longest JIRA id
#set($blanks="                                  ")
#set($indent1=$blanks.substring(0,$blanklen))
## indent2 allows for issue wrapper
#set($indent2="$indent1   ")
##
#macro ( processaction )
## Use replaceAll to fix up LF-only line ends on Windows.
#set($action=$actionItem.getAction().replaceAll("\n","
"))
## Fix up indentation for multi-line action descriptions
#set($action=$action.replaceAll("(?m)^  +",$indent2))
#if ($actionItem.getIssue())
#set($issue="$actionItem.getIssue():")
## Pad shorter issue numbers
#if ($issue.length() < $indent1.length())#set ($issue="$issue ")#end
#if ($issue.length() < $indent1.length())#set ($issue="$issue ")#end
#if ($issue.length() < $indent1.length())#set ($issue="$issue ")#end
#else
#set($issue=$indent1)
#end
#if ($actionItem.getDueTo())
#set($dueto=" Thanks to $actionItem.getDueTo().")
#else
#set($dueto="")
