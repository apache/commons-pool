      <p>
         Object pooling API.
      </p>
      <p>
         The <code>org.apache.commons.pool</code> package defines a simple 
         interface for a pool of object instances, and a handful of base 
         classes that may be useful when creating pool implementations.
      </p>
      <p>
         The <code>pool</code> package itself doesn't define a specific object
         pooling implementation, but rather a contract that implementations may
         support in order to be fully interchangeable.         
      </p>
      <p>
         The <code>pool</code> package separates the way in which instances are
         pooled from the way in which they are created, resulting in a pair of 
         interfaces:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>{@link org.apache.commons.pool.ObjectPool ObjectPool}</dt>
        <dd>
          defines a simple object pooling interface, with methods for 
          borrowing instances from and returning them to the pool.
        </dd>
        <dt>{@link org.apache.commons.pool.PoolableObjectFactory PoolableObjectFactory}</dt>
        <dd>
          defines lifecycle methods for object instances contained within a pool.
          By associating a factory with a pool, the pool can create new object
          instances as needed.
        </dd>
      </dl>        
      <p>
        {@link org.apache.commons.pool.ObjectPoolFactory ObjectPoolFactory}
        defines a simple factory for <code>ObjectPool</code>s, which may be
        useful for some applications.
      </p>
      <p>
         The <code>pool</code> package also provides a keyed pool interface,
         which pools instances of multiple types, accessed according to an 
         arbitrary key. See
         {@link org.apache.commons.pool.KeyedObjectPool KeyedObjectPool},
         {@link org.apache.commons.pool.KeyedPoolableObjectFactory KeyedPoolableObjectFactory},
         and 
         {@link org.apache.commons.pool.KeyedObjectPoolFactory KeyedObjectPoolFactory}.
