              Apache Commons Pool 2.0 RELEASE NOTES

The Commons Pool team is pleased to announce the release of commons-pool2-2.0-SNAPSHOT

Commons Object Pooling Library

This is a major new release that provides significant performance improvements in high concurrency environments. Pools now provide a mechanism for tracking objects that have been borrowed from the pool but not returned. There have been numerous API changes to support these and other new features as well as to clarify behaviour and improve consistency across the API.

Changes in this version include:


Fixed Bugs:
o POOL-188:  Remove confusing method PoolUtils.ErodingKeyedObjectPool.numIdle(K key). Thanks to sebb.
o POOL-150:  Ensure GKOP.preparePool() throws an exception if no factory has been
             defined.
o POOL-134:  Add the ability to specify a per call wait time when borrowing an object.
o POOL-121:  Provide a name for the eviction timer thread.
o POOL-173:  Reduce duplication in configuration code.
o POOL-178:  Re-factor common code into common base classes.
o POOL-100:  Allow custom eviction policies to be defined.

Changes:
o POOL-194:  Replace synchronized blocks in PoolUtils with Read/Write locks.
o POOL-83:   Support Java 1.5 Generics.
o POOL-186:  Developer documentation and examples have to be updated once the 2.0 repackaging has been done
o            Switch GOP to use a pooling mechanism based on java.util.concurrent and a
             LinkedBlockingQueue implementation from Apache Harmony (originally by Doug
             Lea and the JSR-166 expert group).
o            Make deprecated protected attributes private, requiring that access is via
             the appropriate getters.
o            Code clean-up. Add missing @Override annotations, remove unused code,
             remove deprecated code and unnecessary code.
o            Introduce an Enum (WhenExhaustedAction) to control pool behaviour when no
             more objects are available to allocate.
o            Remove WhenExhuastedAction.GROW since it is equivalent to
             WhenExhuastedAction.FAIL with a maxActive value of Integer.MAX_VALUE.
o POOL-155:  Guard against multiple returns of the same object to the pool and ensure
             that only objects borrowed from the pool are returned to it.
o            Remove setFactory() method from GOP.
o POOL-172:  Expose GOP and GKOP attributes via JMX.
o POOL-98:   Add additional attributes (also accessible via JMX) for monitoring.
o            Change meaning of zero for maxWait to a maximum wait of zero milliseconds
             rather than the unexpected infinite wait.
