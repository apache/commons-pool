              Apache Commons Pool 2.4.1 RELEASE NOTES

The Apache Commons Pool team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Commons Pool 2.4.1.

Apache Commons Pool provides an object-pooling API and a number of object pool implementations.
Version 2 contains a completely re-written pooling implementation compared to the 1.x series.
In addition to performance and scalability improvements, version 2 includes robust instance
tracking and pool monitoring. Version 2 requires JDK level 1.6 or above. 

No client code changes are required to migrate from versions 2.0-2.3 to version 2.4.1.
Users of version 1.x should consult the migration guide on the Commons Pool web site.

NOTE: The MBean interfaces (DefaultPooledObjectInfoMBean, GenericKeyedObjectPoolMXBean
      and GenericKeyedObjectPoolMXBean) exist only to define the attributes and methods
      that will be made available via JMX. They must not be implemented by clients as
      they are subject to change between major, minor and patch version releases of
      Commons Pool. Clients that implement any of these interfaces may not, therefore,
      be able to upgrade to a new minor or patch release without requiring code
      changes.

This is a patch release, replacing a defective binary jar in version 2.4.  Other
than the build configuration (pom.xml), the source distribution for version 2.4.1
is identical to version 2.4.

Changes in version 2.4.1 include:

Fixed Bugs:
o POOL-297:  Reverted coburta plugin update that caused binary jar corruption.

Changes in version 2.4 include:

New features:
o POOL-286:  Added preparePool method to GenericObjectPool.

Fixed Bugs:
o POOL-287:  Fixed capacity leak when an object is offered from a GenericKeyedObjectPool while it is
             being validated by the evictor. Thanks to Caleb Spare and Thomas Neidhart.
o POOL-283:  Eliminated the requirement that objects managed by GenericObjectPool or
             GenericKeyedObjectPool be discernible by equals.  Prior to this fix,
             equal but distinct object instances could not be stored in the same pool.
o POOL-284:  Eliminated the requirement that object equality and hashcodes do not change
             while objects are under management by GenericObjectPool or GenericKeyedObjectPool.
o POOL-289:  Fixed class loading for custom EvictionPolicy implementations that may not
             be present in the class loader hierarchy of the Pool classes by falling
             back to the class loader of the current class. Thanks to Luke Winkenbach.
o POOL-285:  Ensured that when an instance that has already been returned to a pool is
             returned again, the expected IllegalStateException is generated before the
             returning object is re-validated or re-passivated.

Changes:
o POOL-296:  Update asm-util from 5.0.3 to 5.0.4.
o POOL-293:  Exposed getEvictionPolicy as protected in BaseGenericObjectPool.
